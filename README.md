# hotel-booking-calendar

This project is a hotel booking calendar built using Vue.js 2 and Vuex. It displays weekly reservations for each apartment, allowing users to navigate forward, backward, and return to the current week.

Here is [DEMO LINK](https://hotel-booking-calendar-8966e.web.app/)

## Requirements

- Vue 2: to create components and manage the UI.
- Vuex: for state management to handle reservations data and navigation state.
Each row in the table represents an apartment, and each column represents a day of the week (Mon-Sun).
Three navigation buttons have been implemented: "Forward" (go back a week), "Back" (go back a week), "Today" (return to the current week).
The booking starts in the middle of the start date and ends in the middle of the end date.
